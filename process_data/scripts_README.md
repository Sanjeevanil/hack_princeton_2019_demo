Place data folder in same local dir as shell file and python scripts.

Edit dir_to_classif.py as needed:
	- data_folder_name (line 4): The name of the folder with all the data
	- json_file_paths (line 5): modify the glob as needed

Run extract_data.sh.

Outputs:
labelled_data.csv is all the data
training_set.csv and validation_set.csv are self-explanatory.
